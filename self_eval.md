# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
- I actually feel really good about built in ruby methods. As with everything I will need to reintroduce that information to myself later to make sure it stays sharp.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
- I am fairly confident writing my own methods. It still took and probably will take some trial and error to make sure my methods are returning what I want them to going forward.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
- I am sure methods can get incredibly complex and specific with multiple layers of calling on stored values, but is there a way to replicate a similar level of complexity without writing lines of code?
